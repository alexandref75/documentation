# SMARTER v2

We are currently refactoring and updating SMARTER and placing into this repository.  Some of the goals for this new version:

- Simplify deployment
  - move to helm based workflow for customization and deployment
  - simplify cloud based deployment to minimal set of services
  - leverage 3rd party platform deployment options versus custom yocto builds
- Update versions of baseline software
- Incorporate updates to triton and other software that forms the examples
